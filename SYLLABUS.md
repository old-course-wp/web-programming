# Syllabus

Here is the tentative syllabus for Web Programming, organized in Learning Units
(LUs). Each LU specifies its objectives, to be read as _"After sucessfully
completing this LU, the student should be able to ..."_.

**This syllabus is subject to radical change**. Winter/Spring 2018 is the first
time Web Programming is being offered, so we may need to make significant
adjustments to the schedule depending on a variety of factors.

This syllabus will be updated throughout the semester, and generally speaking,
the further from present the topic is, the more likely it is to change.
